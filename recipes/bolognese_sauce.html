    <h1 class="title">Bolognese Sauce</h1>
    <img id="dish" src="../images/image.png" alt="delicious bolognese sauce">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan.</p>
    <p>She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought 'Bolognese' 
        was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. 
        I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cups finely diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced carrot</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups 2% milk</li>
        <li>2 cups white wine</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
        <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook onion, celery, and 
            carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into 
            vegetables and cook, stirring constantly until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. 
            Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until most of the milk has evaporated and bottom of pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your fingers until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into sauce; fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from top of sauce if desired. If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a little more water. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
    </ol>
